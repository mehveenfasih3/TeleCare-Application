## Application Description

The application works through several steps. First, the user must download the application on an Android device. After installation, the user can access different modules such as **offline support**, **emergency contact**, and **sign-in functionality**.

If the user navigates to the sign-in screen and does not already have an account, they must first sign up. Supabase sends a verification email; the user needs to open the email and click the provided link to complete the registration. After verification, the user can sign in. Based on the email address, the user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard (Doctor, Patient, or Nurse) and can perform relevant operations.
